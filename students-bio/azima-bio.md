Only at the beginning of this year I realized that I was really interested in
programming, then I tried myself in a 7-day programming marathon from the Go-IT
company and "Voilà!", I found myself everyday learning programming languages.
But I always admired geniuses like Steve Jobs, M. Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and
Elon Musk before it all started.

**Here some funny but inspiring phrases for us for devs, enjoy** :smile:

> "The computer was born to solve problems that did not exist before."
>
> “There is an easy way and a hard way. The hard part is finding the easy way.”
>
> “Computers are good at following instructions but not at reading your mind.”
>
> “Copy-and-Paste was programmed by programmers for programmers actually.”
>
> One main'scrappy software is another man's full time job
>
> “Don’t worry if it doesn’t work right. If everything did, you’d be out of a
> job.”
>
> People don't care about what you say, they care about what you build.
